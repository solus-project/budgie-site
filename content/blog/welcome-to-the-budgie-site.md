Welcome to the new Budgie website. Still in its early days, this website serves to represent the Budgie Desktop project, its development, and its community. It will serve to inform the public
on the latest news regarding this project and is planned to provide comprehensive developer-oriented documentation, enabling people around the world to contribute to the Budgie Desktop project and
help to foster a rich and vibrant community.

This website also serves to represent the future of the Budgie Desktop project with a [Roadmap](/roadmap) providing details and thoughts on the direction and plans of the project. We look forward to your
thoughts and ideas on [how this website](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-site) can improve as well as enable easier engagement in the project.
